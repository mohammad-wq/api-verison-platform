# Local API Version Platform - Requirements and Work Plan

## Purpose

Ship this repository as a Packagist package that runs locally inside a PHP project. It turns a project README written in the platform's Markdown template into versioned API documentation and OpenAPI output.

This is a **single-project, single-user local tool**. It is not a hosted collaboration service.

## Initial-state assessment

The package already provides a useful foundation:

- `vendor/bin/avp-serve` launches a bundled React build and PHP backend.
- `MarkdownOpenApiParser` converts Markdown into OpenAPI 3.0.3.
- Version creation validates Markdown and calculates a normalized OpenAPI SHA-256 hash.
- The packaged frontend and backend are copies of a separate multi-user application.

The current implementation is not aligned with the intended product:

| Area | Current behavior | Required direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | MySQL is mandatory; records refer to users and project membership. | Local package-owned storage; SQLite is the default. |
| Identity | Registration, login, JWT, profiles, users, roles, and project-members tables/routes are active. | No accounts, JWTs, roles, collaborators, or profile UI. |
| Project model | A user can own or join many remote-style projects. | One local project per configured workspace; optional multi-workspace support can be deferred. |
| Source document | Markdown can be uploaded for a version, but is not kept as the working README. | A configured README is the authoritative working file. |
| Change detection | A hash is stored for derived OpenAPI only. No baseline is linked to the README file. | Compare a normalized README hash with the last committed source hash. |
| UI | Compiled bundle includes login/collaboration/share/account flows. | Rebuild a local-only UI; remove those flows completely. |
| CLI | Only `init`, `check`, and serving exist. | Add template, status, version/commit, and history operations. |

Important implementation facts discovered during review:

- `backend/versions/modify/insertUpdateVersion.php` accepts Markdown but stores only the derived `openapi` JSON and its hash. The original document and its committed source hash are lost.
- Most backend routes call `requireAuth()` and depend on `users`, `projects`, `project_members`, or `request_history` tables.
- `resources/ui` is a compiled artifact. Editing it directly is not a maintainable way to remove pages; the source frontend must be changed and rebuilt before `scripts/sync.php` packages it.
- The current `runner/execute.php` is an unrestricted local HTTP request runner with disabled TLS verification. It is unrelated to local versioning and should be removed from the first release unless explicitly retained and secured.
- The repository has no schema installer/migration, even though the README requires a pre-existing MySQL schema.

## Implementation progress

The local core, CLI and template are implemented. The bundled UI is now the hosted web app's React build in its built-in local mode (`client/`, `npm run build:package`), served by `src/LocalApi.php`, which implements the web client's route names for one implicit user and one project on SQLite. Collaborators, login and project deletion are hidden in local mode. The Test APIs tab and its request history are retained: the runner verifies TLS, and the API only accepts loopback `Host` headers and JSON POST bodies. The former multi-user PHP backend is archived under `legacy/`. Remaining release work is automated test coverage and a Packagist release smoke test.

## Product requirements

### 1. Installation and configuration

- The package must install through Composer and expose `vendor/bin/avp` (the existing `avp-serve` name may remain as a compatibility alias during migration).
- `vendor/bin/avp init` must create:
  - `avp.config.php`, containing local paths and storage settings;
  - `.avp/` for package state, ignored by Git; and
  - a default README template if the configured README does not exist and the user requests it.
- The default storage driver is SQLite at `.avp/storage.sqlite`. No MySQL, PDO MySQL extension, database credentials, JWT secret, or web-server configuration may be required.
- Configuration must support at least `readme_path`, `storage_path`, `server.host`, and `server.port`.
- The package must provide a documented `--readme=path` override for commands that operate on the source document.

### 2. README template

- `avp template` writes the canonical Markdown template to stdout; `avp template --output=README.api.md` writes it to a file.
- The web UI must offer **Download README template**. It downloads the exact same template exposed by the CLI.
- The template must be versioned in package source (for example `resources/templates/api-readme.md`) and covered by parser tests.
- A user may configure an existing `README.md`; the package must never overwrite it without an explicit `--force` or confirmed UI action.

### 3. Local version model

- A version is an immutable snapshot with: numeric ID, version label, optional note, full Markdown source, normalized source hash, derived OpenAPI JSON, OpenAPI hash, creation time, and parser warnings/statistics.
- Version labels must be unique within the workspace. The first release may accept any non-empty label; SemVer validation is optional but recommended.
- Editing a historical version is not allowed. A correction creates a new version, preserving an auditable history.
- The latest version is the most recently committed snapshot, unless the user explicitly selects another snapshot as latest.
- Deletion should be soft-delete only if a restore command/UI is supplied; otherwise use a clear permanent-delete confirmation. The first release may omit deletion.

### 4. Git-like working-copy status

The configured README is the working copy. The platform must maintain a single **baseline source hash**: the normalized hash of the Markdown that was last successfully committed as a version.

- `avp status` must report one of: `uninitialized`, `clean`, `modified`, `missing`, or `invalid`.
- `clean` means the current normalized README hash equals the latest committed snapshot's `source_hash`.
- `modified` means the file exists and its normalized README hash differs from that baseline.
- `missing` means the configured file cannot be read; `invalid` means parsing/validation fails. Neither status may silently change the baseline.
- Newline differences (CRLF/LF) and a UTF-8 BOM must not create a false change. Define this normalization once in a shared `SourceHasher` service.
- A successful version commit—whether through CLI or UI—must atomically store the snapshot and advance the baseline. Immediately afterwards, `avp status` and the UI must show `clean`.
- The UI must re-check status on load, after a version commit, after a file is selected/imported, and on an intentional Refresh action. Automatic file watching is optional for the first release because browser access to arbitrary local files is restricted.

### 5. CLI workflow

Required commands:

```text
avp init [--readme=README.md] [--force]
avp template [--output=PATH] [--force]
avp status [--readme=PATH] [--json]
avp version create <label> [--note=TEXT] [--readme=PATH]
avp version list [--json]
avp version show <label> [--format=markdown|openapi|json]
avp serve [--host=127.0.0.1] [--port=8080]
```

- `version create` must refuse an unchanged document by default with a clear message such as “README is clean; no new version created.” A `--allow-unchanged` escape hatch is optional.
- Before writing, it must parse the README, show parser warnings, and fail without changing storage/baseline if validation fails.
- `--json` output must be stable and appropriate for CI usage.
- Exit codes: `0` success/clean, `1` validation or operational failure, `2` changed/uncommitted status (for `status` only).

### 6. Web UI workflow

The web UI is a local frontend only; it may call the package's local PHP API but must not depend on an external service.

- Landing/dashboard: README path, current status, latest version, last commit time, and actions to download template, refresh status, create version, and open history.
- Create version: show version label/note fields, a preview of parser warnings and endpoint count, and a prominent “commit current README” action.
- History: list snapshots with labels, timestamps, notes, hashes, parser statistics, Markdown/OpenAPI download, and a diff view between two versions (line diff is sufficient initially).
- Import/upload: allow the user to choose a Markdown file and explicitly either copy it to the configured README or commit it as a new snapshot. Do not imply continuous filesystem monitoring from the browser.
- Remove every login/register/logout/profile/users/admin/collaborators/project-members/share-link page, navigation item, API client, and token storage behavior.
- Do not display collaboration roles, user avatars, or owner/editor/viewer concepts.

### 7. Local HTTP API

Keep the server router. The API under `/api` is the web client's route set, implemented locally in `src/LocalApi.php` (`/api/local/status`, `/api/local/readme`, `/api/local/readme/save`, and the hosted backend's `.php` route names for projects, versions, the request runner and request history). Scripts and CI use the CLI's `--json` output rather than HTTP.

- No authorization header, cookies, JWT, CORS credential mode, user identity, or user-provided database credentials.
- Bind to `127.0.0.1` by default. If `--host=0.0.0.0` is used, display a warning that the unauthenticated local tool should not be exposed on an untrusted network.
- Keep inputs size-limited and return structured JSON errors.
- The request runner is retained for the Test APIs tab; it verifies TLS, and the API accepts only loopback `Host` headers and JSON POST bodies.

### 8. Storage and migrations

Use SQLite through PDO with `ext-pdo_sqlite` as the only database extension requirement.

Suggested schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE metadata (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE versions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  label TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  note TEXT,
  markdown TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  openapi_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  openapi_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  parser_warnings_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  parser_statistics_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

- Store `schema_version` in `metadata` and run idempotent migrations during `init`, `check`, and normal command startup.
- Use transactions for a version insert plus baseline update.
- The baseline may be derived from the newest version's `source_hash`; storing `last_committed_version_id` in `metadata` makes “latest” explicit and avoids ambiguity after future features.
- SQLite database and any `.avp/` exports must be excluded from the distributed package and recommended in the host project's `.gitignore`.

## Non-functional requirements

- PHP 8.1+ support; add `ext-pdo_sqlite` and remove `ext-pdo_mysql`, `ext-curl`, and JWT requirements unless another retained feature needs them.
- The source of truth must live in this repository. Do not ship only compiled UI output without the frontend source or reproducible build instructions.
- Unit tests must cover Markdown parsing, source normalization/hashing, status transitions, CLI exit codes, SQLite migrations, and atomic commit behavior.
- Integration tests must cover CLI commit → clean status and UI/API commit → clean status.
- Package release metadata must use an OSI-compatible license if publishing publicly on Packagist; `proprietary` is technically accepted by Composer but conflicts with typical public-package expectations.
- Documentation must clearly state that this is a local developer tool and must not be exposed publicly without adding authentication and transport security.

## Recommended implementation order

### Phase 0 — Decide and protect scope

1. Confirm one workspace per installed project for v1.
2. Preserve the existing README change separately; it is currently modified in the working tree.
3. Archive or remove the inherited multi-user backend only after the replacement API is covered by tests.

### Phase 1 — Core local domain

1. Add `Storage`, `MigrationRunner`, `VersionRepository`, `SourceHasher`, `ReadmeService`, and `VersionService` under `src/`.
2. Add the SQLite schema/migrations and `.avp` path resolution.
3. Extract Markdown parsing behind a service and return consistent parse results.
4. Implement atomic create-version behavior and the status state machine.
5. Add automated tests for all status transitions.

### Phase 2 — CLI and template

1. Replace the current parser in `bin/avp-serve` with a command dispatcher, retaining `avp-serve` as an alias if desired.
2. Implement `init`, `template`, `status`, and `version` subcommands.
3. Add the canonical README template and parser fixtures.
4. Update the public README with the install-to-first-version quick start.

### Phase 3 — Local API and server hardening

1. Replace `/backend/*` routing with `/api/*` endpoints backed by the new services.
2. Delete authentication, user, collaborator, share, profile, request-history, and remote-project routes/configuration.
3. Remove unsafe request execution and permissive CORS behavior.
4. Add endpoint tests using a temporary workspace and SQLite database.

### Phase 4 — Rebuild the UI

1. Obtain or restore the React source; do not reverse-edit `resources/ui/assets/index-*.js`.
2. Remove account/collaboration UI and build the local dashboard, commit flow, history, downloads, and diff.
3. Generate the bundled files into `resources/ui/` using the existing sync/release flow.
4. Verify that a UI commit changes status from `modified` to `clean` without a page reload.

### Phase 5 — Release readiness

1. Remove obsolete Composer dependencies and configuration examples.
2. Add a CI matrix for supported PHP versions, linting, unit tests, and package installation smoke test.
3. Add `CHANGELOG.md`, license, security policy, issue templates, and Packagist/GitHub release instructions.
4. Tag a pre-release, install it into a blank PHP project, and verify the full CLI and browser workflow.

## Acceptance scenarios

1. In a blank PHP project, install the package, run `avp init`, download or generate the template, add one endpoint, and run `avp version create v1.0.0`. `avp status` reports `clean`.
2. Edit the configured README. `avp status` returns exit code `2` and reports `modified`; the UI shows a pending change.
3. Commit the modified README from the UI as `v1.1.0`. The version stores the exact Markdown source and generated OpenAPI; the UI immediately reports `clean` and the CLI also reports `clean`.
4. Edit the README again and commit using the CLI. Reloading the UI shows the new latest version and `clean` state.
5. A malformed README produces parser diagnostics and creates no version or baseline update.
6. No route, navigation item, schema, or configuration setting requires login, users, collaborators, JWT, MySQL, or a remote service.

## Explicit v1 exclusions

- Multi-user collaboration, authentication, roles, share links, hosted synchronization, and cloud storage.
- Automatic filesystem watching in the browser.
- Live API request execution, avatars, account management, and user request history.
- Production/public network hosting.
